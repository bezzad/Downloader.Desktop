  # Downloader is not notarized yet, so Homebrew quarantines it and macOS blocks the first
  # launch ("unidentified developer"). Strip the quarantine flag on install so the user does
  # not have to run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ...` by hand after every install/upgrade.

  end

  caveats <<~EOS
    Downloader is not notarized yet. The quarantine flag is removed automatically on install,
    so it should launch normally. If macOS still blocks it, right-click Downloader in
    Applications and choose Open, or run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Downloader.app"
